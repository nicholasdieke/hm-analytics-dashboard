# **Analytics Dashboard for H&M Data**

I have built an analytics dashboard on a set of H&M data about customers, articles, and transactions. The dashboard provides valuable insights into the business by generating KPIs and graphs based on the datasets.

The structure of the project is as follows:

- **API**
  - Python file for the api code using Flask
  - YAML file for deploying to GCP
  - Requirements.txt file for the necessary packages
- **Frontend**
  - Python file for the frontend code using Streamlit
  - YAML file for deploying to GCP
  - Requirements.txt file for the necessary packages
